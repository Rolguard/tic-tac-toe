## Changing the look and feel of the Java Swing JFrame window

- Lack of documentation to customise, only given several default options
  none of which are appealing to me. I want to be able to change the window
  to be of a similar theme to Google Chrome Dark Mode window but you only
  offered default options such as metal for cross-platform and platform-specific
  options that modify the look based on the operating system running the Java
  application e.g. Windows, Linux, MacOS.

Current solution: Found FlatLaf themes after enough searching for more
customisation options
